### BMI 6018 Intro to Programming (2017 Fall) Final Project

# Relationship between amount of 911 calls and characteristics of townships in Montgomery County in Pennsylvania


## Introduction

911 is a three-digit phone number used to report emergencies throughout the United States. The goal of this project is to analyze the correlation between amount of 911 calls and individual townships within Montgomery County in Pennsylvania based on township characteristics. The characteristics include levels of education (high or low), employment (employeed or unemployeed), race (white or others), and income. We hope our analysis can help the government in distribution of appropriate number of necessary service such as police department and hospitality in different township. Our results will be helpful to find out of which townships would need more supervise.

## Data

For this project, we have two datasets:
* 911 calls data: type, event, township
* Township information data: township, number of people with high education, number of employed/unemployed people, number of white people, number of people in each household, population, and income of per household.

##### Note: 
* the 911.csv file we downloaded by Mike Chirico from Kaggle                    
* the Townships of Montgomery County data that we scraped from                                http://statisticalatlas.com/county/Pennsylvania/Montgomery-County/Overview
